        If the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine isn't already in pure powder form,
        then it must be separated from the tablets of cold medicine that contain
        it. To do this, the cold medicine tablets are mixed with a solvent and
        the solution is then filtered and exposed to low temperatures to
        separate and remove the inert material of the tablet. The pure
        pseudoephedrine is then mixed with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid.
        The red phosphorus is then filtered out (and later reused), and the
        remaining acid is neutralized by adding a lye solution. A substance is
        added that will bind to the meth, and the liquid meth is then drained
        out. Hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the liquid meth, making it
        a crystalline hydrochloride salt. This is poured through a filter cloth,
        and the meth that is left on the filter is then dried. Once dry, the
        meth is "stepped on" (mixed down with inert filler in order to maximize
        profits), weighed and packaged for shipment or sale.
