      Good morning. I'm A Martinez. <br />
      A man in Turkey wandered into the forest after a night of drinking. When
      Beyhan Mutlu didn't return, his friends grew concerned and set up a search
      and rescue mission. His friends and lots of volunteers, including Beyhan
      himself, joined the mission. Now, according to local media, the group
      searched the area for hours before Beyhan realized he was the missing
      person. Police then escorted him safely home. And in many ways, aren't we
      all just trying to find ourselves? It's PROGRAMMER EDITION.
